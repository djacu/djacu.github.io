Hi! My name is Daniel Baker (he/they) but I go by Dan these days.

I am an engineer/scientist turned software developer. Currently, I am exploring functional programming via Haskell, Nix and NixOS, and eventually I will get back to learning Rust. You can find out a bit about me below.


# Bio

Dan studied Control Theory, Estimation Theory, and Signal Processing. He spent many years, as a Systems Engineer, analyzing, building, and testing gimbal stabilized platforms. Following that he spent a few years developing Signal Processing and Signal Communications libraries. Now he is passionate about creating clear, maintainable, and well tested code in reproducible systems. He cares about mentoring, teaching, and making complicated software accessible for the end user.
